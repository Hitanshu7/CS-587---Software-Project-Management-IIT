Definition of Software Project Management:

Software project management refers to the branch of project management dedicated to the planning, scheduling, resource allocation, execution, tracking and delivery of software and web projects.
Project management in software engineering is distinct from traditional project management in that software projects have a unique lifecycle process that requires multiple rounds of testing, updating, and customer feedback. Most IT-related projects are managed in the agile style, in order to keep up with the increasing pace of business, and iterate based on customer and stakeholder feedback.
